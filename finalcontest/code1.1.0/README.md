#### This is the first edit
First find the  baseline of the form and generate a universal wave model and use backgroung propagation to train the weight of every position of the time. 

PARAMETERS:

* Find only one universal wave
* Not include channel difference
* Calculate the base line of every single wavefrm to get ride of the statistics fluctuation
* Only use 0 or 1 weight, because the parameters in tensorflow can not be integral, so it is needed to find a line which indicates the exsitence of the PE
* Calculate the source data when generating the standard waveform, so that we can measure the degree of disperision

#### This is the second edit

* Using machine learning training
* Using ordering method
* Not using 'Find peak' method

#### This is the third edit
* Using batch method tho traing the parameters

#### This is the 4th edit
* Find the mode of random signal
* Find the most optimized conbination of STEPS Length_pe PLATNUM THRES BATCH_SIZE & GRAIN

#### This is the 5th edit
* Trying to add the method to use GPU in the server
