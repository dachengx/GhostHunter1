#### This is the first edit
First find the  baseline of the form and generate a universal wave model and use backgroung propagation to train the weight of every position of the time. 

PARAMETERS:

* Find only one universal wave
* Not include channel difference
* Only use 0 or 1 weight, because the parameters in tensorflow can not be integral, so it is needed to find a line which indicates the exsitence of the PE
