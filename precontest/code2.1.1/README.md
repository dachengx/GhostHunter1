Using gradient descent and fully connected network. 
Directly input all the 1029 signals to the NN, and output the probability of existence of PE in each 1029 signal sampling point. 

The data used in generating tfRecord_train and tfRecord_test are the same! 

Pay attention to the 'correct_prediction' and 'loss'

Predict "True" if y[i] > 0.5, otherwise, predict "False"
